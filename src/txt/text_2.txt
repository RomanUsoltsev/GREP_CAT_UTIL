In today's society, decisions are made on the basis of data. Most scientific or industrial studies and experiments produce
data, and the analysis of these data and drawing useful conclusions from them have become one of the central issues.



Statistics is an integral part of the cat quantitative approach to knowledge. The field of statistics is concerned with the scientific
study of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Statistics benefits all of us because of its

ability to predict the future based on data we have previously gathered. Statistical CAT methods help us to transform data into
information and knowledge. Statistical concepts enable cat us to solve problems in a diversity of contexts, add substance to

decisions, and reduce guesswork. The discipline textbook of statistics stemmed from the need to place cat knowledge management on a



CAT
systematic evidence base. TEXTBOOK Earlier works on statistics dealt only with the collection, organization, and presentation of data in
the form cat of tables and charts. In order to place CAT statistical textbook knowledge on a systematic evidence base, we require a study of
the laws of CAT probability. In mathematical TEXTBOOK statistics we create a probabilistic model cat and view the data as a set of random


outcomes from that model. TEXTBOOK Advances in probability theory enable us to draw valid conclusions and to make reasonable
decisions on the basis of data. textbook
